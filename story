**story**
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks.
 She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house.
  She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.
At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. 
She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.
"This porridge is too hot!" she exclaimed.
So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.
"This porridge is too cold," she said.
